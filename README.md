<h2> Game of tech </h2>

<h3>This project involves the design and implementation of an interactive online puzzle for soft skills
assessment. The puzzle aims to evaluate users' soft skills, including attention to detail, perseverance,
and curiosity, through engaging challenges and clues , also this webiste will test users computer network and knowledge of ip addresses. Users can register accounts, progress through
the puzzle, and administrators can analyze user data via an intuitive dashboard. 
It enables users to create accounts using unique email addresses and implement secure user
authentication which is implemented using PassportJS with encrypted password (using bcrypt) storage. It develops a mechanism to track and store user progress, including the time taken for each step and solution accuracy and allow users to resume their
progress or restart the puzzle seamlessly.

This detailed abstract outlines the comprehensive approach taken in developing an interactive puzzle
for soft skills assessment using the MERN stack. By integrating user registration, dynamic puzzle
structures, progress tracking, and an admin dashboard, the project aims to deliver a versatile tool for
assessing and improving soft skills in a gamified and engaging manner. The use of cloud-hosting
platforms enhances accessibility, making the puzzle widely available for users across various devices.
