<h3>This project involves the design and implementation of an interactive online puzzle for soft skills
assessment. The puzzle aims to evaluate users' soft skills, including attention to detail, perseverance,
and curiosity, through engaging challenges and clues. Users can register accounts, progress through
the puzzle, and administrators can analyze user data via an intuitive dashboard. The project prioritizes
accessibility and seamless deployment on cloud-hosting platforms.
It enables users to create accounts using unique email addresses and implement secure user
authentication with encrypted password storage. It develops a mechanism to track and store user
progress, including the time taken for each step and solution accuracy and allow users to resume their
progress or restart the puzzle seamlessly. To ensure broad accessibility, the interactive puzzle is
deployed on cloud-hosting platforms, allowing users to engage with the assessment seamlessly from
any device with an internet connection. This deployment strategy aligns with the project's
commitment to providing a user-friendly experience.
This detailed abstract outlines the comprehensive approach taken in developing an interactive puzzle
for soft skills assessment using the MERN stack. By integrating user registration, dynamic puzzle
structures, progress tracking, and an admin dashboard, the project aims to deliver a versatile tool for
assessing and improving soft skills in a gamified and engaging manner. The use of cloud-hosting
platforms enhances accessibility, making the puzzle widely available for users across various devices.
